## Update Pain Points Card #3

**File**: `src/components/PainPoints.tsx`

**Change**: In the `pains` array (index 2), replace the third card's content:

- **Title**: `"Growth that doesn't scale"` → `"Growth = chaos."`
- **Description**: `"More leads should be exciting. Instead, each new customer adds more chaos to your plate."` → `"More leads should be exciting.\nInstead, each new customer adds more chaos to your plate."`

The description text stays the same as before but the title changes. Single-file, single-object edit. No other sections affected.
